# Explore PH Indie Music

This is a data visualization project about the current Filipino indie music scene. It uses d3, [graph-scroll](https://github.com/1wheel/graph-scroll), and [howler](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js).
View it [here](https://xacasi.github.io/ph-indie-datavis/).

See the [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/xacasi/ph-indie-analysis/blob/master/The%20Sound%20of%20Indie.ipynb) for data analysis done prior to making the visualization.
